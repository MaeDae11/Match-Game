# Match-Game
Codecademy Project: Matching Game focusing on jQuery, JavaScript and Bootstrap


Match Game is currently an unfinshed project. I hope to get back to it soon.

<b>Overall</b>
This is a project worked on through Codecademy. It focuses on appending data to the DOM from jQuery and Javascript. 
It's a simple match game that starts will all the tiles facing down. To start, you click on a tile, it flips over, and you try to find the matching tile. 
If you do not click the correct matching tile, they both flip back over and you try again. 


<b>Difficulties</b>
- Within JavaScript and jQuery, the 16 numbers start off with an array that must be shuffled. To do this shuffle, I finally found the Fisher-Yates Shuffle. This helped tremendously and is incredbily useful and efficient.
- I am also having difficulty in figuring out how to make sure the tiles seem "face down" yet still retain the value. I've messed around with toggling classes to no avail. Again, I hope to work on this soon when I have some free time.
